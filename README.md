# Window (TBD...)

Eleventy template to create simple presentations. Based on [HTeuMeuLeu's idea](https://twitter.com/HTeuMeuLeu/status/1279448003284217859) and [workshop materials](https://workshop.hteumeuleu.com/).

The idea is to offer a simple way for speakers to create slides in an easy way so they can focus on the content and don't lose time on styling, animating ,uploading... It's also way more accessible, responsive and fast!
